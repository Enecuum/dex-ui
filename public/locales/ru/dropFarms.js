The aim is to reduce the lower threshold to enable more token owners to participate in the process. Currently, the minimum stake required is 500,000 enq on the token issuer's account. The voting process will begin on April 13 and last for two weeks, and members of the community are encouraged to participate. The mining slot mechanism is crucial for mining user tokens on the Enecuum network, and further information can be found on the Enecuum blog and documentation."
